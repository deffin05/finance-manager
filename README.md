# Finance manager

## Description

This is a web app for tracking personal finances. It allows you to view
your savings from different sources, such as stocks, cryptocurrencies
and other currencies. It will be displayed in an overall dashboard 
with a graph to see your profits or losses over time. We plan to support
integrations with Monobank and probably other financial institutions.
